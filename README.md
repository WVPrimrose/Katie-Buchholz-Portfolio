# Katie-Buchholz-Portfolio
This project details that I will create a starter portfolio website to showcase potental employers.

The project includes a header with my name, a navigation bar with links to each section of the page:
an About section detailing who I am as a developer and as a person,
a Portfolio section detailing my current projects,
and a contact section listing my contact information.

This is a developing project that will be routining updating over the course of my time in the coding bootcamp and in my potential coding career.
